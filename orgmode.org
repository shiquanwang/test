* Overview
ews-orgmode is a python script to fetch your exchange calendar using exchange webservices and format it
into an orgmode readable format for using it in your orgmode agenda.

* Installation
Clone the repository using:

: git clone http://github.com/kautsig/ews-orgmode.git

Change into the directory and create a config file:

: cd ews-orgmode
: cp config.cfg.sample config.cfg
: emacs config.cfg

The config.cfg is within the .gitignore file, so you don't publish it by accident.
Now, run the script:

: ./ews-fetch-calendar.py

If everythings ok, you should see your exchange calendar in orgmode format as console output. You 
can redirect it into an orgmode file for using in your agenda. E.g. you could  use something like this
in a cronjob:

: ./ews-fetch-calendar.py > ~/org/exchange.org

* Disclaimer
Use the script at your own risk. Read it, understand it, modify it. But do not
blame me if something goes wrong.
